## Password Encryption
Easily encrypt any form of text or password just simply calling the encrypt function, Adding this to your project can help in many ways, My intial thought when making this script is
when adding a password to a DB it makes passwords extra secure and stores passwords inside the DB that are completely encrypted.

## How to use
Downloading the Encryption.js File
After downloading the file I made a few comments down at the bottom of the script that allow you to export the script to whatever runtime you are using

encrypt paramters (string, optional decrypt = false) 

decrypt paramters (string) 
You can make a variable and pass it through here it accepts whatever string that was recently encrypted.

## Current problems
I will be adding a new update to this soon but at the momment there are a few symbols that it currently does not accept, Along with spaces.
